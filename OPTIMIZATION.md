# Neural Network Optimization through Knowledge Distillation and Quantization

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### The Imperative for Model Compression

Modern deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance across numerous computer vision tasks, often at the cost of substantial computational and memory requirements. State-of-the-art models like ResNet-152, while highly accurate, demand significant resources that make them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This fundamental tension between model performance and computational efficiency has driven the development of model compression techniques.

**Key Challenges in Real-World Deployment:**
- **Memory Constraints**: Limited RAM and storage on edge devices
- **Computational Bottlenecks**: Insufficient processing power for real-time inference
- **Energy Limitations**: Battery-powered devices require energy-efficient models
- **Latency Requirements**: Real-time applications demand fast inference
- **Cost Considerations**: Expensive hardware increases deployment costs

### Project Motivation

This project addresses these challenges by implementing and evaluating two complementary model compression techniques: **Knowledge Distillation** and **Quantization**. By systematically applying these methods to CIFAR-10 classification, we establish a robust foundation for deploying compressed models in real-world scenarios where computational resources are at a premium.

The ultimate goal extends beyond academic explorationâ€”this work serves as the foundational phase for a wildfire detection system that will operate on tower-mounted cameras in remote, resource-constrained environments.

## ðŸ§  Knowledge Distillation: Theory and Implementation

### Theoretical Foundation

Knowledge Distillation, introduced by Hinton et al. (2015), is a model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a large, complex "teacher" model to a smaller, more efficient "student" model. This paradigm leverages the rich representational knowledge embedded in the teacher's learned parameters to guide the training of the student network.

#### Core Concepts

**Teacher-Student Architecture:**
```
Teacher Model (ResNet-152)     Student Model (ResNet-18)
â”œâ”€â”€ High capacity              â”œâ”€â”€ Compact architecture  
â”œâ”€â”€ Complex representations    â”œâ”€â”€ Efficient computation
â””â”€â”€ Soft probability outputs   â””â”€â”€ Distilled knowledge
```

**Knowledge Transfer Mechanism:**
The fundamental insight behind knowledge distillation is that the teacher model's softmax outputs contain more information than simple hard labels. These "soft targets" encode the teacher's confidence distribution across all classes, revealing inter-class relationships and uncertainty patterns that are lost in one-hot encoded labels.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Temperature Scaling

The teacher's output logits `z_t` are converted to soft targets using temperature-scaled softmax:

```
p_i^soft = exp(z_i^t / T) / Î£_j exp(z_j^t / T)
```

Where:
- `T` is the temperature parameter (T > 1 for softer distributions)
- Higher temperatures produce softer probability distributions
- `T = 1` reduces to standard softmax

#### Distillation Loss Function

The student model is trained using a weighted combination of two loss terms:

```
L_distillation = Î± * L_soft + (1 - Î±) * L_hard
```

**Soft Loss (Knowledge Transfer):**
```
L_soft = TÂ² * KL_divergence(p_student^soft, p_teacher^soft)
```

**Hard Loss (Ground Truth Learning):**
```
L_hard = CrossEntropy(p_student, y_true)
```

Where:
- `Î±` âˆˆ [0,1] balances soft and hard loss contributions
- `TÂ²` scaling factor compensates for temperature scaling
- `KL_divergence` measures distributional difference between teacher and student

#### Hyperparameter Configuration

**Temperature (T = 4.0):**
- Controls softness of probability distributions
- Higher values reveal more inter-class relationships
- Typical range: 3-6 for computer vision tasks

**Alpha (Î± = 0.7):**
- Emphasizes learning from teacher over ground truth
- Higher values prioritize knowledge transfer
- Balance depends on teacher quality and task complexity

### Implementation Strategy

Our implementation follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Teacher Training**: ResNet-152 with aggressive regularization
2. **Soft Label Generation**: Extract temperature-scaled predictions
3. **Student Training**: ResNet-18 with combined distillation loss
4. **Evaluation**: Compare against baseline ResNet-18 trained independently

## âš¡ Quantization: Precision Reduction for Efficiency

### Theoretical Foundations

Quantization reduces model size and computational requirements by representing weights and activations with fewer bits than standard 32-bit floating-point precision. This technique exploits the observation that neural networks often maintain acceptable performance even with significantly reduced numerical precision.

#### Types of Quantization

**Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**
- Applied after model training is complete
- Minimal accuracy degradation for many models
- Fast deployment pipeline without retraining
- Limited optimization compared to quantization-aware training

**Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**
- Simulates quantization effects during training
- Model learns to compensate for precision loss
- Better accuracy preservation but requires retraining
- More computationally intensive than PTQ

### Mathematical Framework

#### Linear Quantization

For a floating-point value `x`, quantization maps to an integer representation:

```
x_quantized = round((x - zero_point) / scale)
x_dequantized = scale * x_quantized + zero_point
```

**Parameters:**
- `scale`: Controls quantization step size
- `zero_point`: Ensures zero maps exactly to an integer
- `round()`: Rounding function (typically nearest integer)

#### Bitwidth Considerations

**8-bit Quantization (INT8):**
- Standard choice balancing compression and accuracy
- 4x memory reduction compared to FP32
- Hardware-accelerated on most modern processors
- Minimal accuracy loss for most computer vision models

**Lower Bitwidths (4-bit, 2-bit):**
- Extreme compression with potential accuracy degradation
- Specialized hardware or software support required
- Research-focused with limited production deployment

### Performance Trade-offs

| Precision | Memory Reduction | Speed Improvement | Accuracy Impact |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| FP32 (Baseline) | 1x | 1x | Baseline |
| INT8 | 4x | 2-4x | < 1% degradation |
| INT4 | 8x | 4-8x | 1-5% degradation |
| INT2 | 16x | 8-16x | 5-15% degradation |

### Implementation Pipeline

Our quantization workflow encompasses:

1. **Model Preparation**: Convert trained student model to quantization format
2. **Calibration**: Use representative data to determine optimal quantization parameters
3. **Quantization**: Apply precision reduction to weights and activations
4. **Evaluation**: Assess performance degradation and efficiency gains
